nullmailer (1:1.05-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Nullmailer now supports IPv6 addresses for smarthosts in the remotes
    file, either as hostnames or as IPv6 address literals.  To enter
    an IPv6 address literal at the debconf 'relayhost' prompt, quote it
    in square brackets, as below.

    [fe80::5054:ff:fef4:ef81]

    The square brackets will be removed before expanding the colon
    separated smarthost list into /etc/nullmailer/remotes.
