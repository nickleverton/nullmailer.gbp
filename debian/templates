Template: shared/mailname
Type: string
_Description: Please enter the mail name of your system:
 This is the fully-qualified host name of the computer running nullmailer.
 It defaults to the literal name 'me'.

Template: nullmailer/relayhost
Type: string
_Description: Please specify your smarthosts:
 This is a colon-separated list of remote servers to which to send each
 message. Each entry contains a remote host name or address followed by
 an optional protocol string 'host protocol'. The protocol name defaults
 to smtp, and may be followed by command-line arguments for that module.
 .
 Examples:
 .
   smarthost
   smarthost smtp --port=10025
   smarthost:mx.domain:192.168.1.1

Template: nullmailer/adminaddr
Type: string
_Description: To which address shall nullmailer send local emails (optional)?
 If not empty, all recipients to users at either 'localhost' (the literal
 string) or the canonical host name (from /etc/mailname) are remapped to
 this address. This is provided to allow local daemons to be able to send
 email to 'somebody@localhost' and have it go somewhere sensible instead of
 being bounced by your relay host.
