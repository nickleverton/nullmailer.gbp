# This prompt is not shown to the user.

_Description: The domain name to be appended to hostnames:
 This is the domain name which will be added to any hostnames that don't

Template: nullmailer/relayhost
Type: string
#flag:translate!:4
_Description: Smarthosts:
 This is a colon-separated list of remote servers to which to send each
 message. Each entry contains a remote host name or address followed by
 an optional protocol string 'host protocol'. The protocol name defaults
 to smtp, and may be followed by command-line arguments for that module.
 .
 Examples:
 .
   smarthost
   smarthost smtp --port=10025
   mail.example.com smtp --user=foo --pass=bar
   192.168.1.254 qmqp 
   [fe80::5054:ff:fef4:ef81] smtp 

Template: nullmailer/adminaddr
Type: string
_Description: Where to send local emails (optional):
 If not empty, all recipients to users at either 'localhost' (the literal
 string) or the canonical host name (from /etc/mailname) are remapped to
 this address. This is provided to allow local daemons to be able to send
 email to 'somebody@localhost' and have it go somewhere sensible instead of
 being bounced by your relay host.
