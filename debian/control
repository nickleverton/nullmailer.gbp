Description: simple relay-only mail transport agent
 Nullmailer is a replacement MTA for hosts, which relay to a fixed set of
 smart relays. It is designed to be simple to configure and especially
 useful on slave machines and in chroots.

 The sendmail interface of this package doesn't provide the -bs switch,
 hence it's not LSB compatible!
