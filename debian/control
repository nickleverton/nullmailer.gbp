Description: simple relay-only mail transport agent
 Nullmailer is a replacement MTA for hosts, which relay to a fixed set of
 smart relays. It is designed to be simple to configure and especially
 useful on slave machines and in chroots.
 .
 This package omits the /usr/lib/sendmail binary and does not Provide:
 mail-transport-agent, so that it can be installed on the same
 machine as a full MTA.  Hence it's not LSB compatible.  To provide a
 mail-transport-agent, install nullmailer-sendmail as well.

Description: simple relay-only mail transport agent - sendmail binary
 Nullmailer is a replacement MTA for hosts, which relay to a fixed set of
 smart relays. It is designed to be simple to configure and especially
 useful on slave machines and in chroots.
 .
 This package includes the /usr/{sbin,lib}/sendmail binary and Provides:
 mail-transport-agent when installed in conjunction with nullmailer.
 .
 The sendmail interface of this package doesn't provide the -bs switch,
 hence it's not LSB compatible!
