nullmailer (1:2.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Arguments to remotes must now be given as "option=value" or
    "--option=value". The undocumented form "option value" is no longer
    supported. Please refer to nullmailer-send(8) for supported options
    and syntax.

nullmailer (1:2.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Support for sysvinit is not available in this version.  This support
    relied on a patch against upstream which is no longer being carried in
    Debian.

  * protocol for remotes has changed to pass options on STDIN, one per
    line, and to read the actual message on file descriptor 3.  This
    mitigates certain password sniffing attacks, but will require updating
    custom protocols.

nullmailer (1:1.05-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Nullmailer now supports IPv6 addresses for smarthosts in the remotes
    file, either as hostnames or as IPv6 address literals.  To enter
    an IPv6 address literal at the debconf 'relayhost' prompt, quote it
    in square brackets, as below.

    [fe80::5054:ff:fef4:ef81]

    The square brackets will be removed before expanding the colon
    separated smarthost list into /etc/nullmailer/remotes.
