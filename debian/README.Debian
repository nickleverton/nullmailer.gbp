+---------------------------+
| logging and backgrounding |
+---------------------------+

On request of its users the Debian version of nullmailer-send behaves
differently from the corresponding upstream release. It forks into the
background on startup and it sends status output to the system log daemon
instead to standard error. If you have no running system log daemon, output
will be sent to /dev/console. As of 1.00RC7-12 this behavior is optional
and needs to be requested using nullmailer-send's --daemon and --syslog
options (Debian only), see nullmailer-send(8).

Note that the Debian version of nullmailer executes under the system account
mail with group root. It uses /etc/mailname instead of the /etc/nullmailer/me
control file, in compliance with the Debian Policy Manual.


+---------------------------+
| /etc/aliases              |
+---------------------------+

nullmailer doesn't support /etc/aliases, the newaliases command provides a
dummy script for policy compliance only. A catch-all alias for local users may
be achieved using the adminaddr(5) control file.


+---------------------------+
| nullmailer and Pine       |
+---------------------------+

You cannot use Pine with nullmailer, but you can configure Pine to connect to
your smarthost instead. To do so set the configuration option 'smtp-server' in
your /etc/pine.conf. This will bypass nullmailer's mail queue, i.e. you'll
need to be online while sending emails using Pine.


+---------------------------+
| mailing lists             |
+---------------------------+

There is an upstream mailing list at http://lists.em.ca/?list=nullmailer.
While talking to upstream, please keep in mind that there are Debian specific
differences as mentioned above. Please address Debian specific questions to
debian-user[-<language>]@lists.debian.org or nullmailer@packages.debian.org
instead.
