This program does not read in any dates from the user in any format.
Any date manipulation is done in terms of seconds since the UNIX epoch.
Any conversion from seconds into a readable form includes a full four
digit year.  As far as I am aware, no parts of this package will have
any problems on the year 2000 or well beyond.
