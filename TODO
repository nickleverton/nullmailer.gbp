- Add support for SMTP AUTH CRAM-MD5

- Document proto/smtp use $HELOHOST for the HELO string.

- Convert all proto modules to use timedout reads.

- Add support for authentication to protocols.

*** Add a delayed delivery notification system somehow ***

- Remove "adminaddr" facility from -queue, and add a more general
  destination address rewriting facility to -inject:
  - Read a list containing "PATTERN:ADDRESS" lines.
  - PATTERN can be a literal "user@FQDN" or just "user", in which case
    it must be matched exactly (before qualification).
  - PATTERN can be "@FQDN" which matches any user.

- For version 1.1:
  - Add a "failed" queue directory for permanently failed messages.

- For version 2: three-state queueing
  - Queue message partially (tmp -> holding)
  - Send to smarthost immediately
  - Remove from holding if sending succeeds
  - Complete queueing (holding -> queue) if sending is deferred
  - Return with an error if sending fails (permanently)
  - Move all from holding -> queue on startup of nullmailer-send
